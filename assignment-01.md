8. You have RM 10,000 savings and want to purchase shares as an investment for earning side income. 
You have listed two potential companies and need to select one company to invest. 
Comparing _Pentamaster Corporation Bhd._ and _ViTrox Corporation Bhd._ Justify your investment choice. 
-Pentamaster’s net profit margin of 26.75% has edged Vitrox’s net profit margin of 23.45%. Vitrox’s ROE of 16.51% is higher than Pentamaster’s ROE of 13.94%, and may give the impression that Vitrox’s management is slightly more efficient in allocating and converting every dollar of investor capital into profit. I will award a tie here as both companies have each won one of the profitability metrics. 
-In terms of current ratio, there is nothing much between the ratios of 4.94 for Vitrox versus 4.55 for Pentamaster. But perhaps, Pentamaster has a slightly better     cash ratio of 3.37 versus 2.16 for Vitrox. Additionally, I should not be concerned about the liquidity positions of Vitrox and Pentamaster since both companies are in net cash positions. In other words, both companies have sufficient cash to meet all its short and long term debt obligations. Overall, I am impressed by both companies but will award the win to Pentamaster for its better cash position – as at 31 December 2019, the company has net cash of RM419.89 million on its balance sheet compared to the net cash position of RM142.86 million for Vitrox.
After the analysis, I will choose to invest in pentamaster, due to its superior statistics in growth, profits(net and ROE), along with its higher liquidity, which can translate to company stability to a certain degree.
